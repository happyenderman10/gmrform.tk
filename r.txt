1- No Advertising.


This includes all forms of ads, DM Advertising, Direct Link Advertising, and name advertising.

2- NSFW content.

NSFW (Not Safe For Work) content is strictly not allowed in any of the channels, and if posted will result in a ban. Keep things safe for work in all channels. This includes, but is not limited to, emotes, profile pictures, and images.

3- No Spamming

There are a few types of spamming, chat flooding, DM spamming, and mention spam. Doing any of these will result in quite severe consequences.
- Any type of spamming will not be allowed
- Text chains and emoji chains
- Do not spam reactions ( react to every message )

4- Name / Profile Picture

Your status has nothing to do with us, it is fine if you are advertising your own service in your status. However, having a nickname that contains an advertisement or a username will have us take action and either change your nick or removal from the server if you keep breaking the rule.

5- Respect the staff team.

We're here to keep the server clean and relaxed, so when we ask you to stop doing something, please do so! If you have any questions or objections, feel free to create a ticket about it or report your issue / any inappropriate behavior. Do not ping staff unless there is a matter that needs immediate attention.

6- No alt accounts. 

Alternate accounts are not permitted in the server. Please only join with one account or we'll ban them all. If your account is younger than 2-3 weeks it will deserve a ban.

7- No raiding.

Any attempts of raiding will result in a permanent ban. Discussion of raiding is also strictly not allowed.
